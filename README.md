# Python-code-for-a-score
Here's a program that prompts the user for a score, checks if it's within the range of 0.0 to 1.0, and prints out the corresponding grade: >= 0.9 A >= 0.8 B >= 0.7 C >= 0.6 D &lt; 0.6 F If the user enters a value out of range, the code will print a suitable error message and exit.
